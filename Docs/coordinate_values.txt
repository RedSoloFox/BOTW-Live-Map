Units of the map seem to be roughly 10000 across and 8000 top to bottom. Split in half with 5000 being x=0 and 4000 being y=0

x [-5000, 5000]
y [-4000, 4000]

Using the resolution of the image for leaflet is apparently necessary, [12000, 10000] is 0,0 on the coordinate system. >12000 is negative and >10000 is also negative
